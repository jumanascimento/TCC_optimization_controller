abstract = {Background
While acute risks concerning underwater divers are well-documented, the literature regarding the long-term impacts on pulmonary function remains inconclusive. Although oxygen toxicity at high partial pressures is established for patients in intensive care, the impact of diving seems limited.
Research Question
What are the long-term effects of SCUBA diving on pulmonary function in military divers?
Study design and Methods
This longitudinal study used routinely collected data from the Military Hospital of Sainte-Anne, Toulon, over a 20-year follow-up period. We expressed spirometric measures as a percentage of predicted values to account for age, height, and ethnicity, and analysed it using mixed-effects models. The impact of diving is assessed for different gas and diving apparatus. Other included variables were atopy, smoking history, and body mass index.
Results
331 divers were included (2685 spirometric measurements), with an average follow-up of 23.9 years and 2491 dives. Only male divers met inclusion criteria. Baseline FEV1 matched predicted values (100.00%, SD=11.98). Every 1000 dives, FEV1 increased by 3.21% (95% CI [2.73–3.68], p < 0.001), regardless of gas or apparatus. FVC (3.02%, [2.52–3.53], p < 0.001) and FEF75% (10.12%, [8.29–11.95], p<0.001) increased, while FEV1/FVC remained stable. Each BMI point increase was associated with a 0.51% rise in FVC (p=0.010) and 0.38% rise in FEV1 (p = 0.032), while each pack-year was associated with a 1.12% decline in FEF75% (p=0.005).
Interpretation
SCUBA diving is associated with increased pulmonary flows and volumes in this population of military divers. Prospective studies could explore the role of unmeasured confounding factors and could significantly contribute to health policies for both military and civilian divers.}
